Spring Data Model Implementation
Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing a data model within a Spring Boot application. The primary task was to create entity classes based on a predefined data model, integrating them into the application using JPA (Java Persistence API) annotations. The project leverages Spring Boot for rapid development, IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE, and Git for version control. The implementation ensures that entities are correctly mapped to a database, with auto-generated IDs, proper annotations, and accessor methods.
Key Points About the Project

Objective: Develop entity classes in the entities directory to represent the data model, adhering to JPA standards.
Entity Requirements:
Each entity class is annotated with @Entity to mark it as a JPA entity.
IDs are auto-generated using @Id and @GeneratedValue.
Instance variables use @Column for attributes or relationship annotations (e.g., @OneToMany, @ManyToOne) for associations.
Each class includes a constructor to initialize all fields and provides getter/setter methods (no setter for IDs).


Development Process:
Forked and cloned the starter repository to begin development.
Used IntelliJ IDEA to explore the codebase and implement entities.
Tested the application to verify entity mappings and database integration.
Committed changes to GitHub for version control and submission.


Learning Outcomes:
Gained familiarity with Spring Boot and JPA for database interactions.
Improved understanding of Git workflows (forking, cloning, committing, pushing).
Learned to navigate and extend a pre-existing Spring application.

Structure Highlights

entities: Houses all entity classes, each annotated with JPA annotations to map to database tables.
controllers: Manages HTTP requests and responses, interacting with services to process data.
repositories: Provides data access methods for CRUD operations, leveraging Spring Data JPA.
services: Contains business logic, acting as an intermediary between controllers and repositories.
application.properties: Configures the application, including database connection details and JPA settings.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard Spring Boot structure, organized for clarity and modularity:
```src
└── main
    ├── java
    │   └── com.example
    │       ├── entities        # Contains JPA entity classes representing the data model
    │       ├── controllers     # REST controllers for handling API requests
    │       ├── repositories    # JPA repositories for database operations
    │       └── services        # Service classes for business logic
    └── resources
        └── application.properties  # Configuration file for Spring Boot and database settings
